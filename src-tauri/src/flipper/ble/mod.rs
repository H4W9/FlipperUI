//! Bluetooth LE transport for the Flipper Zero.
//!
//! Flipper exposes a GATT "Serial" service that carries the same varint-framed
//! protobuf RPC as USB. Unlike USB serial, this service is RPC-only — there is
//! no text CLI mode over BLE. Pairing must be performed at the OS level first;
//! btleplug cannot initiate bonding.
